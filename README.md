## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

You theme is setup just like a normal Jelyll site! To test your theme, run
`bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`.
This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc.
like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your
theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the
changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, and
`_sass` tracked with Git will be released.
